  Applied to following datasets: NLP, computer vision and speech recognition.
  
  ## Convolutional Networks
  Implementation of convolutional Networks
  
  Applied to following datasets: computer vision and speech recognition.
  
  ## Dataset Augmentation:
  Collection of Funcitons to augment image datasets.
  
  ## GAN:
  Augmentation of datasets using GAN functions
  
  ## LSTM:
  Implementation of LSTM functions
  
  (this exercise was adapted to work with cough recordings and has some extra functions)
